#AWS Cloud Services

##Introduction to AWS

This is a really really really really really really really really really really
really really really really really really really really really really long
paragraph that should definitely be wrapped by prettier because it exceeds the
print width.

- First item with lots of spaces
- Second item with different spacing
  - Nested item with wrong indentation
  - Way too deeply indented item

1.  First numbered item
2.  Second with extra spaces
3.  Third with different spacing

###Core Services

**Amazon S3** provides object storage with extra spaces.

## Additional AWS Services

This section covers more AWS services with messy formatting that needs fixing.

**Amazon EC2** offers virtual servers.

Code example with inconsistent formatting:

```
const   example   =   {
name:    "test",
value:     123
}
```

Random paragraph with way too many blank lines above and below.

- Another list
- With inconsistent spacing
- And wrong indentation
