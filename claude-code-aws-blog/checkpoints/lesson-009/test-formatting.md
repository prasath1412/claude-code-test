#Heading Without Space

##Another Heading with Wrong Spacing

This is a paragraph with way too many blank lines above it.

This is a really long line that goes on and on and on and on and on and on and
on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
and on and on and should probably be wrapped.

- List item with inconsistent spacing
- Another item with different spacing
- Yet another with wrong indentation
  - Deeply nested with too much indentation

1.  Numbered list
2.  Inconsistent spacing
3.  Different spacing again

###Yet Another Heading

Random spaces between words.

## New Section Added

This is a new section that I'm adding to test the formatting hook.

## Testing Hook Again

This should trigger the formatter with the fixed configuration.

**Bold text** with extra spaces.

Code block with inconsistent formatting:

```
function test() {
    console.log("test")
}
```

Too many blank lines below.
