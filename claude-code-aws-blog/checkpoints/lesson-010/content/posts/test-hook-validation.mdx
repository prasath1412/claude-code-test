# Testing Hook Validation

This blog post has intentionally incorrect frontmatter to test our validation
hook.

## What Should Happen

The PostToolUse hook should catch these errors:

- Empty title
- Invalid date format (month 99, day 99)
- Empty author
- Invalid category (should be one of: Bedrock, Infrastructure, MCP, CI/CD, Best
  Practices)
- Tags as string instead of array
- Published as string instead of boolean

Let's see if the hook catches all of these!
