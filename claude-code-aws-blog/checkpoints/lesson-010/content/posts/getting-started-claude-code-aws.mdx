# Getting Started with Claude Code on AWS

Claude Code is a powerful AI-powered development tool that integrates seamlessly
with AWS Bedrock. This guide will walk you through the setup process and show
you how to leverage Claude's capabilities for your AWS projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An AWS account with Bedrock access
- Claude Code CLI installed
- Basic familiarity with AWS services
- Node.js 18+ installed

## Setting Up AWS Bedrock

First, you'll need to enable AWS Bedrock in your AWS account:

1. Navigate to the AWS Bedrock console
2. Request access to Claude models (if not already granted)
3. Create an IAM role with appropriate Bedrock permissions
4. Configure your AWS credentials locally

```bash
aws configure
```

## Installing Claude Code

Install Claude Code CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
```

## Connecting to AWS Bedrock

Configure Claude Code to use AWS Bedrock as the model provider:

```bash
claude-code config set provider bedrock
claude-code config set model claude-3-sonnet
claude-code config set region us-east-1
```

## Your First AI-Powered Workflow

Let's create a simple example to test your setup:

```typescript
// example.ts
export function processData(data: any[]) {
  // Ask Claude Code to implement this function
  // Claude will analyze the context and generate appropriate code
}
```

Run Claude Code and ask it to implement the function:

```
/implement processData function that filters and transforms user data
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific prompts**: The more context you provide, the better Claude's
   suggestions
2. **Leverage AWS context**: Claude understands AWS service patterns and best
   practices
3. **Iterate incrementally**: Build features step by step with Claude's
   assistance
4. **Review generated code**: Always review and test AI-generated code

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter issues during setup, here are some common problems and their
solutions:

**Authentication Errors**: If you receive authentication errors when connecting
to Bedrock, verify that your AWS credentials are correctly configured and that
your IAM role has the necessary permissions. You can check this by running
`aws sts get-caller-identity` to confirm your identity.

**Model Access Denied**: Some Claude models require explicit access requests in
the AWS Bedrock console. Navigate to the Model access page in Bedrock and
request access to the specific Claude model versions you need (Claude 3 Sonnet,
Claude 3 Opus, etc.).

**Region Availability**: Not all AWS regions support Bedrock. Currently, Bedrock
is available in us-east-1, us-west-2, and several other regions. Make sure
you're using a supported region in your configuration.

- Check AWS service health dashboard for outages
- Review CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
  - Enable debug mode in Claude Code for verbose logging
    - Use `claude-code --debug` flag for troubleshooting

**Connection Timeouts**: If you experience timeouts, this could be due to
network issues or VPC configurations. Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS
traffic to AWS Bedrock endpoints.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Claude Code set up with AWS Bedrock, you can:

- Explore MCP servers for extended capabilities
- Set up CI/CD workflows with Claude Code
- Build production-ready applications with AI assistance

Happy coding with Claude on AWS!
